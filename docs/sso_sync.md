## Introduction

A sync job was set up between AWS SSO and the Google directory which runs in the root account. The source code for the sync can be found in this repository [https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/ssosync](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/ssosync). It was forked from [https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync).
