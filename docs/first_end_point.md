## Introduction

We have created a video that gives developers a good understanding of how we build API Endpoints from beginning to end, following best practices. 

The video below will go through the following steps:

- Creating a repository using Hackneyâ€™s Base API template
- Using our Renamer Script to rename the repository
- How we set up our automated pipeline using CircleCI 
- Git commands to push the repository to GitHub
- A high-level overview of managing the infrastructure code using Terraform
- How to build a GET Endpoint 
- Manual Tests that can be carried out using Postman
