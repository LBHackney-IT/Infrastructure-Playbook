*This playbook is a work in progress.*

Who are the [Cloud engineering team](/the_team)?

## Why a Playbook?
Our Playbook is our open documentation library for using the AWS platform at Hackney. As a living document, it will be updated regularly as we iterate the platform and introduce new components. 

Some pages link to documents that require an LBH login. If you have an LBH login and still can't see the document, use the Request Access button.

## Who this Playbook is for
The Playbook is for anyone building in the Hackney AWS environment - both officers and colleagues from digital agencies. But we also want to share how we do things with the wider world, to help out others and to get feedback. 

## How do I get access to AWS?

Requests can be posted in the [#aws_sso](https://hackit-lbh.slack.com/archives/C01CY495YJY) Slack channel. You must be a member of LBH Slack for this. 

Please provide information on your AWS access requirements. e.g.
- your team/project
- account(s) you need to access
- a similar user
- your full-name and hackney email

## Help us improve
We are always looking at ways we can improve. If you have any ideas or suggestions please share your feedback on our playbook [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/Infrastructure-Playbook).
