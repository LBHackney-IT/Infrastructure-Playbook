We have a [patching module](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/infrastructure/tree/master/modules/aws-patching-lbh/module) which will automatically scan EC2 instances running Windows for Critical or Important patches. It can also be customised to apply the patches. See [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Resl-jxIfvPQUCbnUcY26dcnJSUFaKuM/view?usp=sharing) for more info.
