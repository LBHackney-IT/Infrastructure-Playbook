title: AppStream and Globalprotect
---
We use AppStream and Globalprotect for access to:
- Productivity applications that require a Windows desktop, such as the Adobe suite
- Certain line-of-business applications that have an installed client, such as Academy
- Browser applications that do not have native 2FA or support Google SSO

As a general rule, AppStream is preferred for the first two and Globalprotect for the latter. There may be rare exceptions to this, such as where an application requires a VPN connection **and** a Windows desktop. Be aware of the cost implications of using AppStream and always check if Globalprotect will meet your needs.
