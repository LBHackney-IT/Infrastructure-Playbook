## Introduction
- Our network architecture uses a hub-and-spoke model, with all accounts in each environment attached to a central hub. This hub alone has access to the firewall. 
- All traffic is scanned north/south and east/west. 
- Staging and Production Hubs are high-availability.
- The ability to create new networking resources outside the Hub is restricted. 

More information will be published here in due course, with private links to diagrams.
