title: Definition of Done
---
The Cloud Engineering Team's Definition of Done is broken down into the following:

## Approved by the end user
Work that has complete needs to be approved by the end user to ensure that the requirements have been fully met.

## Passes automated testing
The code passes automated tests and will not be considered done until all tests pass.

 ## Documentation is updated and centrally located
Where applicable, once a piece of work is complete, any assosciated documentation is updated or creating accordingly and if possibly added to the Infrastructure Playbook.

## Peer reviewed by a member of the team
A piece of work whether it is code, design or documentation must be peer reviewed by at least one other member of the team. If a piece of work is particularly complex then a demo can be done for the wider team to understand and review.

## Handover to relevant team or users
If the result of a piece of work is going to be handed over to another team or person then a handover process must be documented and a handover should be arranged with the team that will take ownership of the service.
