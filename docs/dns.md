We manage our own DNS using [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). This is done via Terraform --Â see [the repo](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/infrastructure/tree/master/platform/public-dns) for more details. Anyone can raise a PR, but they are all reviewed by the Cloud Engineering team. For a review, please post in #ask-devops on Slack.
