# Infrastructure Playbook Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Contains all documentation related to [Hackney AWS Infrastructure](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/infrastructure).

Any changes made to `main` will trigger a publish to https://playbook.hackney.gov.uk/Infrastructure-Playbook, but should you wish to develop locally:

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
